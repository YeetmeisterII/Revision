    <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Assume the left side of the list is sorted</li>
        <li>Look at the first and second item. If the second item is bigger do nothing, if smaller switch them</li>
        <li>
            Repeat this process with the second and third items but if they switch then compare the first item with the
            third to see if they should switch
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this process until the end of the list at which point it shall be sorted</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Starting with the first and second number</li>
        <li>
            If they're in the right order, do nothing. If the order is wrong, swap them and record that you made a
            swap
        </li>
        <li>Then move on to the second and third numbers</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous two actions until the end of the list</li>
        <li>If the number of swaps is not 0, repeat the iteration over the whole list</li>
        <li>When the number of swaps is 0 after an iteration over the list it is sorted</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Split a list of \(N\) items into \(N\) lists of \(1\) item</li>
        <li>
            Take the first two lists and merge them with the lowest value being placed first and the higher of the two
            being placed second
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this for each pair of lists with one item until you only have lists with two items</li>
        <li>
            For each pair of lists with two items in them. Compare the first item in each list and add it to the next
            list
        </li>
        <li>
            Compare the first item in the two lists again (It's important to note that one of the lists will have one
            item in it at this point)
        </li>
        <li>Do this until all 4 items are in the new list</li>
        <li>Repeat the process building up longer and longer lists until you have a list of the original length</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Quick Sort</h2>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Pick a random number to be the pivot</li>
        <li>A pointer on the left looks for the first value that is greater than or equal to the pivot</li>
        <li>A pointer on the right looks for the first value that is less than the pivot until it reaches the pivot</li>
        <li>
            If both pointers are on the pivot then you have found the pivot's final position, else swap the positions of
            the two values with pointers
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the process picking a new pivot every time a pivot's final position is found until the list is
            ordered
        </li>
    </ol>
