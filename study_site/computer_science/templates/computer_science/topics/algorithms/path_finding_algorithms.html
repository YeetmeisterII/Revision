    <h1>Path Finding Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Dijkstra"s Algorithm</h2>
    <p>A shortest path algorithm.</p>
    <p>
        Will always find the shortest path between two points on a network, it is not the most efficient method of path
        finding but will always find the shortest path with certainty.
    </p>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Pick an starting node and ending node</li>
        <li>
            Assume all nodes except from the ending node have a distance of infinity from the ending node, the ending
            node has a distance of zero from the ending node
        </li>
        <li>Now pick the node \(N\) with the lowest distance from the starting node</li>
        <li>
            Look at a node around it, call it \(M\). If the shortest route of \(N\) plus the distance of edge \(MN\)
            is less than the shortest route of \(M\), set \(M\)"s shortest route equal to it
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this process for every node connected to \(N\)</li>
        <li>
            Once you have done this mark off \(N\) as visited and repeat the process of picking the node with lowest
            distance from the ending node, however exclude nodes marked off as visited from being pick or having it"s
            edges checked when looking at the nodes around a node being visited
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the process until you have visited the ending node</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>A* Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        A variation of Dijkstra"s algorithm that uses a heuristic weighting to help reduce the amount of searching but
        will still find the shortest path with certainty.
    </p>
    <ol class="instruction">
        <li>Begin at the start node and make it the current node</li>
        <li></li>
