    <h1>Data Structures</h1>
    <h2>Linked Lists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to lists</li>
        <li>Each item has data and a pointer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tree</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Used to represent hierarchical data</li>
        <li>Each node is connected to other nodes</li>
        <li>Nodes with no children are leaves</li>
        <li>Nodes with no parents are roots</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Binary Trees</h3>
    <p>The same as a regular tree but can only have up to two children.</p>
    <h3>Traversal</h3>
    <h4>Depth First Search</h4>
    <p>Travel down the left hand path until you reach a leaf</p>
    <p>Then head back up the hierarchical structure until you can go down down the tree again.</p>
